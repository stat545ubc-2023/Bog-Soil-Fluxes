## Introduction of the Apps
Burns Bog is a bog ecosystem located in Delta, BC. It has experienced a fire in 2016. The postfire area had a high density of pine seedlings, which could lower the water table depth and increase the carbon emissions. The local government started to remove those seedlings as post-fire management since 2019 and would like to test the hypothesis that seedling removal can decrease the CO2 flux (FCO2) and increase the CH4 flux (FCH4). Burns Bog Flux Analysis apps visualize FCO2 and FCH4 in response to various treatments in bog ecosystems. Users can interact with field data collected by Zoe, ensuring transparency and promoting open science.
